   		<h2>About Me</h2>
   			<img src="">
			
			<p>I am 27 years old, hail from Michigan after leaving Ohio, and have lived in Chicago for six years.  I like apples...and icecream.  We order pizza once a week at work, so obviously I'm on a good track here.  I play piano and have a small kitten at home who is an attention craving crazy thing.  I like to read, and I am also obsessed with a murder podcast </p>
